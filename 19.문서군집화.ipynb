                                                    I purchased a 2004 V6,  Leather and I did not think Honda could do any better with design or performance .\\n31

        Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .\\n34                                                                                                                                 The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights .\\n35                                                                                                        I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability .\\n36

tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .\\n39                                                   My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .\\n40

                                                                            I have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues .\\n42                                                                                                    The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana

and ride of this car .\\n46                                                                                        When I first tested the EX, L V6, the performance and handling of the car sold me,  I had to get it and I did .\\n47                                                                                                                                                  Honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .\\n48                                                                                                                                         Its ride, comfort and overall

parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order  wed booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                               I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .\\n13

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15

for valet parking .\\n17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle its cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &amp;quot gotcha&amp;quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35

              The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38

                                                                     I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

   The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                                         Check for

                                        I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking

have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59

get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

allowed this, so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\\n63

                     Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71

by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74

for one day .\\n75

was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF .\\n78                                                                                                                     Upon arriving, there was

talk about below .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We have all paid for our covers whether it's an  extra  cost or added in to the price of the e, reader .\\n5

                                       Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .\\n20

           Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?\\n21

                                                                                                                                                                                               since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23

degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                        As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36

worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38

the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39

                                                                                                                                                              I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41

without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

                                                          Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located

The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54

buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

                                        Turns out some of them were the same price, while others were much cheaper for the Kindle .\\n69

the question of how much she would actually use it .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                   I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&amp;N Nook until i compared book prices between B&amp;N and Amazon .\\n71

                       Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .\\n72

a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .\\n74

have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .\\n75

prices for the new releases .\\n78

              In Super Performance mode CPU, Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .\\n1                                                                                                                  One word of advice is to be really careful about which anti, malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks .\\n2

ya :\\n11                                                                                                                           The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not

                                                         Just some advice ,  use Eset's anti, virus and not Norton, McAfee, CA or the like ,  if not you will loose a lot in performance .\\n13

couple of apps running and its performance is great .\\n16  Amazon seems to be concerned that I am simply  experiencing performance or compatibility problems , , and that my computer thus does not qualify as  defective  by their criteria, , but I would contend that a new computer that cannot be supplied with electricity is a complete lemon .\\n17

the performance .\\n20

out after 60 days .\\n40                                                                                              The performance is fantastic ,  opening a browser, establishing wireless

thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .\\n43

after using it for 15 odd days, i am very satisfied with its performance .\\n45

Francisco with no car at all .\\n3                                                                                                         They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   There was valet parking at a cost of $42 .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                      Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .\\n7

parking the car at the front \\n8

                                                                                                                              Our room rate was all in order  wed booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

discount on parking .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                   On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .\\n14

parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19

knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle its cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22

while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24

                                                                                                                                                                                                         We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32

.\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34

                                                                                                                                                                                   Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37

available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40

provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

                                It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you wont have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

                                            Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

.\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\\n72

                                                                              In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

                     30 am, we discovered that the parking garage next door   would not be open until 7 ,  7 :\\n77

                                 If a case was included, as with the Kindle 1, that would have been reflected in a higher price .\\n0

have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

talk about below .\\n4

                                       Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .\\n20

cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23

degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                        As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                      Disappointing given the prices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

        Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .\\n59

list of 20 books .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                       Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                            for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and

                                                     Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the
